## Introduction

Dog breed identification is a challenging problem due to the subtle differences between breeds. This project focuses on building a predictive model using deep learning to accurately identify the breed of a dog from an image. The goal is to create a reliable classifier that can assist in various applications, such as pet adoption, veterinary services, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes images of various dog breeds. Each image is labeled with the corresponding breed name. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. you can download the dataset here [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).

## Model

The project uses the MobileNetV2 architecture, a lightweight deep learning model designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. The main steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the images and labels for training.
2. **Model Training**: Training the MobileNetV2 model on the dataset using transfer learning.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test set to ensure accuracy and robustness.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
